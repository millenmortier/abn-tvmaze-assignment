As Homeland Security's new think tank, O'Brien's \"Scorpion\" team includes Toby Curtis an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru. Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O'Brien. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them. At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.</p>",

            '<p><b>NCIS: New Orleans </b>is a drama about the local field office that investigates criminal cases involving military personnel in The Big Easy, a city known for its music, entertainment and decadence. Leading the team is Special Agent Dwayne Pride, a.k.a. "King," a native of New Orleans who is driven by his need to do what is right. Working with Pride is Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, who plays hard but works harder and former ATF agent Sonja Percy, who is still adjusting to the team after years of solo undercover assignments. Supporting them is coroner Dr. Loretta Wade, who is as eccentric as she is smart; her brilliant, quirky Forensic Scientist, Sebastian Lund; and Investigative Computer Specialist Patton Plame, an animated and talented hacker. New to the team is Special Agent Tammy Gregorio, a tough, acerbic FBI agent with a mysterious past in New Orleans, who is sent from D.C. to investigate the NCIS team, but also work with Pride when high-risk cases threaten the city. This colorful city that harbors a dark side is a magnet for service personnel on leave, and when overindulgence is followed by trouble, Pride\'s team is at its best</p>',

Marco understands the slippery politics of Mexican law enforcement, and while his police force slowly succumbs to the pressures and demands of the cartel, he's one of the last good men in the department. He's charming but will do whatever it takes to get what he needs -- which doesn't sit well with Sonya, who has Asperger's and strictly follows rules and protocol. The case quickly pulls them into a string of murders on the border, a scene already consumed by illegal immigration, drug trafficking, violence, and prostitution.</p>",

Arriving in France with four close friends as her ladies-in-waiting, Mary has been sent to secure Scotland's strategic alliance by formalizing her arranged engagement to the French king's dashing son, Prince Francis.

Zelda, having grown up with a hippie mom who believed the universe would provide for everything, rebelled into a no-nonsense practical lawyer who prefers the control of online dating. But when a computer glitch sends her a total mismatch, she's asked to come in for an interview at the Internet dating site where Andrew works, and this is where it all begins.

After all, he's convinced she's the shimmering girl in the silver dress. Is it true love forever or just a detour in destiny?</p>",

Dolvett Quince and Jen Widerstrom return to train eight contestant teams of two, all with compelling stories. Seven teams (spouses, parent/adult child, siblings, relatives, best friends) will know each other, but one team will be two strangers - former "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant and the original "Survivor" winner, Richard Hatch, and \'The Voice\' season two semi-finalist Erin Willett. Having both been in the NBC family previously, the two share the same goal as the other 14 contestants - to change their lives and get healthy. The renovated "Biggest Loser" gym, featuring a new interior and exterior branded with the new logo, has modernized equipment to help contestants better achieve their fitness goals, including eight high-tech monitors on the walls of each side of the gym that will track contestants\' calorie burns as well as heart rates. Half of the gym will be dedicated to Team Dolvett and the other half dedicated to Team Jen. The weigh-in will be very different this season with a new look and double scales, so contestants on opposing teams can weigh-in side by side, making the weigh-in even more compelling to watch. The contestant house is also getting a whole new look for season 17.</p>',
